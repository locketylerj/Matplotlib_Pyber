This pythonn script uses Matplotlib to provide guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

Python script analyzes a mock company's complete recordset of rides. Mock information about every active driver and historic rides, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

The script builds a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, the sccript produces the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
